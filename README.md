# AIconomy

This project is an example of reinforcement learning applied to the global economy. It uses AI and reinforcement learning to analyze the potential factors that could impact the global economy and make predictions about the future. The model uses historical macroeconomic and microeconomic data, as well as the current political landscape, to simulate the global economy and make predictions about the future. The AI and reinforcement learning system then adjusts the variables in the model in order to achieve the desired outcome.

This project is written in Python and uses the NumPy, Pandas, and Keras libraries. The code consists of an EconomyEnv class that is used to create the environment, an Agent class that is used to create the agent, and a train function that is used to train the agent. 

This project is intended to be used as an example of how to apply AI and reinforcement learning to the global economy. It is not intended to be a complete solution, but rather a starting point for further exploration and development.
